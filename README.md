# Arcwave Forms

Arcwave Form is a custom Sitecore API designed to facilitate the management of external data from forms that are hosted outside of Sitecore or do not utilize Sitecore Forms. The primary purpose of this API is to seamlessly send data collected from external forms to Sitecore Email Experience Manager (EXM) for the purpose of sending emails.
